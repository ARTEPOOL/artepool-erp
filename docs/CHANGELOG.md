## M0 — Foundations (2026-10-07)

**In plain words:** the invisible backbone is built and proven by 176 automatic tests. There are no screens yet; those come in M1.

- **Database safety rules:**
  - nothing can be deleted
  - nothing can be written without a known user
  - final records cannot change
  - every write is recorded in the audit diary
- **Tamper-evident audit diary:** each entry is sealed with a fingerprint chained to the previous one. A secret change made with full database access is caught at the exact entry (`pnpm demo:audit-tamper`).
- **Gapless numbering:** 13 series (`POS-`, `INV-`, `CN-`, `Q-`, `RCT-`, …). 50 simultaneous requests, some of them cancelled, still give 1, 2, 3… with no gaps or repeats.
- **Money calculator:**
  - integers only: fils, plus 4-decimal unit prices
  - VAT calculated per line
  - discounts spread exactly across lines
  - the same rounding rule in the app and in the database, proven by shared test cases
- **Safe database upgrade tool:** it refuses to run an upgrade file that was edited after use.
- **Users, roles and permissions:**
  - 5 default roles
  - 64 permissions, 11 of which a supervisor can approve once
  - the agreed role matrix
- **Settings:** 22 settings with the agreed defaults (oversell with approval, silent POS receipts, "Copy" on reprints, e-invoicing date pending).
- **Server core:** one transaction per business operation with automatic retry after a deadlock, strict time limits, no secrets in logs, and a `/health` check.
- **Tooling:** CI on GitHub runs everything on PostgreSQL 18. A step-by-step Windows setup guide is included.
